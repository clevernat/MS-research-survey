    <h1>CELL LIFE CYCLE CROWD-BASED ASSESSMENT</h1>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Nathaniel Oteng</strong>. As part of my
      <strong>MS thesis</strong> advised by
      <strong>Professor Bart Geerts</strong> at the University of Wyoming, I am
      seeking expert volunteers to participate in a meteorological pattern
      recognition survey. The objective of this survey is crowd-based assessment
      of convection lifecycle based on first principles. The convection studied
      here is maritime convection of mediocre depth (4-5 km) that forms when
      cold air moves over relatively warm water. The key data source is the
      profiling Ka-band ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR) deployed on the northern
      Norwegian coast as part of the Cold-air Outbreak in the Marine Boundary
      Layer Experiment (COMBLE)

      This lifecycle classification has two parts: one is observational analysis
      (Part 1), the other use the LES model output (Part 2). For Part 1, we have
      objectively identified 57 cells from KAZR profiles during an intense
      Cold-Air Outbreak on 13 March 2020. An additional dataset is from a
      scanning C-band radar network, which depicts horizontal cloud structure
      and evolution. For Part 2, we use a large-domain large-eddy simulation
      (LES) with a resolution of 30 m and 150 m over the entire Norwegian Sea
      from the Arctic Sea down to northern Scandinavia
