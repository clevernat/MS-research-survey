        You will find two folders named OBSERVATION and LARGE EDDY SIMULATION
        (LES).

      <li>
        Both the OBSERVATION folder and the LES folder contain two files, a
        powerpoint and an excel file
      </li>
      <li>
        You will be using the images in the powerpoint files for your survey.
        Each convective cell has its own slide with plots of radar and other
        data. You are asked to classify these cells based on those plots.
      </li>

        You complete your survey in the excel files, which you have to download,
        edit, and then email to me upon completion (noteng@uwyo.edu)
